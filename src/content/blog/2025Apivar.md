Hey y'all,

The Best time to prepare of winter with your bees is the summer! We do get a small fall flow of honey in our 
area that will help bolster the hives, but we need to set them up as best as we can as beekeepers. We apply Apivar
strips in the summer, oxalic acid in the fall and winter, formic acide in the early spring.
Some of these can be applied with supers, but we avoid doing so to keep our honey as clean as possible.
